+++

Couple days ago I gave my first ever talk at [StockholmJS](http://www.meetup.com/sthlm-js/events/230511628/) meetup. Topic was "_Workflow Driven Development_". It is about architectural choices we've made for our new frontend at [Nordnet](https://www.nordnet.se) and why we did them. It was great to see how ideas we have for our frontend architecture are also interesting to other developers. I've got some good feedback and interesting questions afterwards.

Slides for the talk could be found here - [Workflow Driven Development](http://www.slideshare.net/DmitryDemyankov/workflow-driven-development). Maybe there's even going to be a video of my talk later.
